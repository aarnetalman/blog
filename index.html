I'm a Senior AI Engineer at [Silo AI](https://www.silo.ai). Silo AI is the largest
private AI lab in the Nordics.

I'm also a researcher and a PhD student in Language Technology at 
[University of Helsinki](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/language-technology/). 
My research focuses on natural language processing, natural language
understanding, machine translation and machine learning. I'm currently working
on my PhD on Natural Language Inference. 

I have 15 years of experience in software development, architecture, management
consulting, startup business, 
AI/ML and NLP development and academic research.
